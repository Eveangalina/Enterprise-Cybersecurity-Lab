# Cloud Security Principles and Frameworks

### <u>Levels of abstraction in AWS</u>
You can think of the levels of abstration like renting different types of properties:

**Virtual Machines (VMs):** Like renting an entire house. You have control over everything inside but also have to manage everything yourself.
<br/>

**Containers:** Similar to renting an apartment. You have your own space, but some resources like heating or water are managed by the building.<br/>

**Serverless/Functions:** It's like staying in a hotel. You just use the room without worrying about maintenance or utilities.<br/>

Each level offers different control and ease of use. VMs give you more control but require more management, while serverless is more about focusing on what you want to do (like coding) without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### <u>What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?</u>



### <u>Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?</u>
