## Malware Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

My job as a Malware Analyst is like being on the lookout for sneaky software that tries to mess with our computers or steal our information. I dive into the code of suspicious programs to figure out what they're up to, kind of like solving a puzzle to protect our digital world.

*The malware analysis process has <u>six</u> main steps:* <br/>

**Fully Automated Analysis:** This is where we use tools to quickly scan and get a basic idea of what a suspicious file might do. <br/>

**Static Properties Analysis:** We look at the file’s details like strings, hashes, and metadata without running it. <br/>

**Interactive Behavior Analysis:** Here, we run the malware in a controlled environment to see what it does—like how it interacts with the network or changes the system. <br/>

**Manual Code Reversing:** This involves digging into the malware’s code to understand its hidden capabilities. <br/>

**Hybrid Analysis:** A mix of static and dynamic analysis to get the best of both worlds. <br/>

**Malware Research:** This is where we study malware to understand the latest threats and improve defenses.

*A good mnemonic to remember these is "FISH MR" — Fully automated, Interactive, Static, Hybrid, Manual, and Research.*

When faced with a new malware sample, I’d start with a static analysis. It's a safe way to gather some quick insights without the risk of running the malware. This can help us figure out if we're dealing with a known threat or something new, and it sets the stage for a deeper dive if needed. Plus, it's a bit like gathering all the clues before we confront the suspect—it's always good to know what we're up against!
