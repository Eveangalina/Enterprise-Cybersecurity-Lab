## Threat Hunting with Security Onion
**How do Threat Hunting and Penetration Testing differ?** <br/>

Threat hunting involves proactively scouring through a network to identify existing security breaches, whereas penetration testing is a proactive approach focused on finding potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the future.

**What is the primary goal of Threat Hunting?** <br/>

The main aim of threat hunting is to uncover security breaches that have gone undetected, such as identifying covert malware communications with a command and control server outside the network that have not triggered an alert in the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

**How would you promote the practice of Threat Hunting within an organization that has a Security Operations Center (SOC) but does not engage in Threat Hunting?** <br/>

Given that the SOC is already well-staffed and operational, integrating threat hunting into our security measures is a logical step. <br/>
It utilizes existing resources and expertise, and it can be conducted during periods typically reserved for monitoring alerts, thereby maximizing the efficiency of the team and enhancing our security posture without incurring additional costs. It offers a layer of defense, catching the rare threats that might slip past the SIEM's surveillance.
