**What are the three common stages of the Penetration Testing Process and what tasks are performed at each one?**

The penetration testing process typically involves three stages: Reconnaissance, where you gather information about the target system; Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment, where you identify specific weaknesses; and Exploitation, where you attempt to breach the system using the vulnerabilities you've found.

**Explain a “main-in-the-middle proxy” in non-technical terms.**

A "main-in-the-middle proxy" is like someone secretly listening to and recording your phone conversation. They can hear everything you're saying and even pretend to be you to the person on the other end.

**What are the 2 spiders available for use in ZAP?**

ZAP offers two types of spiders: <br/>
<u>The traditional spider</u> that detects links in the HTML code, and the <br/><u>AJAX spider</u> which can click buttons and run JavaScript like a real user.

**What situations are they best suited for?**

The traditional spider is best for quickly crawling a site with mostly static content. The AJAX spider is suited for applications that use a lot of JavaScript to load data dynamically.
