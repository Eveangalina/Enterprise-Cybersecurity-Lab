## Remote Code Execution

- As a Cyber Threat Analyst, my job is like being a digital detective. I use technology to protect our company from hackers and cyber threats. I look for suspicious activities, analyze potential security risks, and help make sure our digital environment is safe. It's about keeping our data and systems secure from people trying to steal or damage them.

- PowerShell is an effective attack vector because it is a powerful scripting tool built into Windows, allowing for automation of administrative tasks. Attackers exploit it for its deep access to the system and network resources, its ability to execute commands across systems, and its presence on all modern Windows systems, making it a common tool that doesn't arouse suspicion. Its extensive capabilities enable attackers to carry out sophisticated attacks and evade detection by leveraging the same tool that system administrators use for legitimate purposes.

- *Two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell;*
<br/>

**Enable Logging**: Configure PowerShell logging features to record all script executions. This helps in detecting malicious activities by keeping a record of scripts that are run.
<br/>

**Restrict Execution Policies:** Implement execution policies to control the conditions under which PowerShell scripts are allowed to run. This prevents the execution of potentially harmful scripts by limiting script execution to those that are trusted or digitally signed.
