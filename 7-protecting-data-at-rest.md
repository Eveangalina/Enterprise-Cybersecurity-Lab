### Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.
- For **confidentiality**, encryption ensures that data remains private and accessible only to authorized users by converting it into a coded format. Regarding **integrity**, encryption helps to protect data from unauthorized alterations, as any tampering would be detectable. Lastly, while encryption doesn't directly impact **availability**, it ensures that data remains secure and trustworthy, indirectly supporting its reliable access and use by authorized entities.
