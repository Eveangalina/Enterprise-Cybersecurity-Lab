[What is Burp Suite?](https://www.technipages.com/what-is-burp-suite)

**Burp Suite** functions as an intercepting proxy, allowing it to sit between the user's browser and the web servers. This enables Burp Suite to intercept, inspect, modify, and resend any requests and responses that pass through it, which helps in analyzing the HTTP/S traffic of a web application. Users can view and analyze the data being sent and received, which aids in understanding the application's operation and in identifying potential security issues.

The Repeater tool in Burp Suite allows us to take an intercepted HTTP request and manually modify it. This can be used to change parameters, headers, cookies, or any part of the request to see how the server responds to these changes. It's primarily used to test for input handling issues by sending variations of the original request and observing the responses, without affecting the rest of the browsing experience.

For an attacker, Burp Suite can be useful because it provides a detailed look at the web application's traffic, revealing how the application processes data. Attackers can leverage this information to find vulnerabilities such as input validation flaws, session management issues, and other security weaknesses. With the Repeater tool, an attacker can easily craft and automate attacks based on the insights gained, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.
